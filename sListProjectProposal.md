## I. Executive Summary.
  The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed description of what is expected of this mobile application. This software is intended to create a list which can be manipulated by several users through credentials verification and cloud computing.The software should be used for lists such as shopping list, gift list, desired item list, among other lists. This mobile app should ensure object-oriented programming and interactivity with the different users in their different operating systems.<br>
  The software meaning and utility can be measure by its capabilities of being able to store and retrieve data and by allowing the different users to have access to the same shared list. Shopping can be overwhelming for some people, we may forget what we were intended to buy or end up acquiring a different product. Hence, sList must be able to assist users in this specific task in order to ease a daily task.<br>
  Even though this app in a future could serve users globally, initially it will be designed to assist a reduce number of users due to the lack of storage. Therefore, the app will serve a short population during the first releases.
Mobile applications have been being developed in an exponential pace which makes the current market very competitive. This application will compete against other applications which have been in market now for a long time and have built a reputation. However, we expect the characteristic of allowing several users to interact with a common list to play in our favor and make a path for this app in the current market.
## II. Vision.
  This software intended use is to allow different users to interact with a common list which store data. The software provides additional features such as price and where a specific item can be located. The users are allowed to put input and modify items. However, some items will be predefined by the developers. The app is designed to work with cloud computing in order to ensure scalability and performance.<br>
  Possible problems to be faced are connecting to a cloud and storing and retrieving data from it. Since the app will work with a cloud as a database, this app relies on connection to the internet. Also, how much storage a user can have must be reviewed and defined by developers in current or coming releases.<br>
  However, these problem do not present a major hazard to the performance of the application and developers and confident that these possible issues would not be of concern during the first releases of the application and may open an area for possible advancements.
## III. Market/Industry Analysis.
  This software is intended for users who are interested in having a shared list where data can be manipulated by different people. There are no age restrictions for the use of this application and the idea is to help users in a daily task. <br>
  This software competes with several different applications which have been in market for a long time and have built a reputation. However, developers think that by allowing the manipulation of a single list by several users may be the key to make a way for a path for this application in the current market.<br> 
## IV. Implementation Development Strategy.
  We expect to create an object oriented application for smartphones using a complex understanding of programming and a high level programming language such as Java. In order to accomplish this, we will start the implementation of our app by setting up the login feature first in order to proceed to the cloud connection a manipulation of the data. In order to succeed, the developers will be assigned specific tasks according to the area of most experience. However, it is expected to share knowledge among developers since the main idea of this application is to expand current programming skills for next projects.<br>
  sList mobile application faces some risks. The biggest one is not being able to have enough storage for the different users. Other risks are not being able to store and retrieve data in a reasonable amount of time and not being able to keep track of changes being made to the list by different users.<br> 
  Other concerns are that the app should only store data input by the user and that mobile devices’ integrity must not be put in danger. Developers must ensure that a device’s battery and sensitive data are not compromised. <br>
## V. Customer Discover.
  A possible user is a user who is interested in having a list in order to have access to information regarding a task. This user must want a digital application which allows interactivity and manipulation. However, the user must understand that the app must perform only this act and nothing else in order to minimize risks and to not lose sight of the purpose of the application
## VI. Project Journal.
  - (10/20/2017) – Project was initiated. WhatsApp group was created as the main communication resource. 
  - (10/22/2017) – Project Proposal document was completed.
